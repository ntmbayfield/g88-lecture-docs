# About Web Development Immersive

- Q1: html/css/javascript
- Q2: Node/Express/Postgres
- Q3: Frontend Frameworks - Angular and React

^ Just to give you a little bit of info about this program. The students come from a variety of background, some technical, most not. The program is 6 months, M-F 9-5.  We focus on learning to learn, pairing, group work, and of course the massive technical curriculum that we offer. In the first quarter the students studied html/css/javascript, in the second quarter they dug into server side technologies (Node, Express, and postgres).
