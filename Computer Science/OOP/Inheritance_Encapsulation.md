#Objectives
- Be able to describe
	- Inheritance and the types of inheritance.
	- Subclasses and superclasses.
	- Uninheritable classes and Overriding.
	- The difference between class and prototypal inheritance.
	- Encapsulation

#Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class.

^How has this been implemented in languages you are familiar with?

---

#Its main advantage is code reuse and to allow for extension of original software.

---

#Subclass
##Derived class or child class.

---

#Superclass
##Base class or parent class.

---

#Types of Inheritance

---


#Single Inheritance
##Where subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. 

---

#Multiple Inheritance

##Where one subclass can have more than one superclass.

---

#Multilevel Inheritance
##Where a subclass inherits the features of another subclass.

---

#Hierarchical Inheritance
##Where one class serves as a superclass for more than one subslass.

---

#Other Concepts

---

#Uninheritable Classes
##In some languages a class might be declared as uninheritable.  
##Example: the final keyword in Java or sealed keyword in C#.

---

#Overriding

##Replacing a property or method that is inherited.

---

#Class vs Prototypal Inheritance

---

#A class is like a blueprint or a description of the object to be created.

---

#A prototype is a actual working object.  

---

#Objects inherit directly from other objects.

---

#Encapsulation

---

##Encapsulation is the bundling of data with methods that operate on that data.

---

##Encapsulation is also used to hide data or methods preventing unauthorized parties' direct access.
