# Ruby on Rails

## Objectives:

- Define what MVC stands for
- Compare MVC implementation between RoR and Node/Express
- Build a CRUD app in Rails in less than 3 hours

# Research with Partner (2 min) what is an MVC?

```
git clone https://github.com/craigquincy/rails_messages.git
```

---

## With a partner clone the messages app and answer the following questions.

- What is the equivalent to package.json?
- Where is the database connection info defined?
- Where are migrations and seeds defined?
- What is the equivalent on the routes file?  Hint: look in /app/controllers directory
- Where are models defined?
- Is there an equivalent to app.js or server.js?
