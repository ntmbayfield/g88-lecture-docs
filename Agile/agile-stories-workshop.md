# Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- explain the user story format
- explain some of the INVEST acronym
- write a user story

---

# User Story Format

A user story must provide value to some user. Use a format for each story that identifies __who__ the user is, __what__ they need, and for __what purpose__ (the why). Such stories are written in this format:

“As a ____, I need a ____ in order to ____”.

“As a jazz fan, I need a tuning knob in order to find a jazz station on the radio that I will enjoy listening to.”

---

# Story = Value

- A story must have value to someone.
- The high priority stories affect the most users or procure the highest value data.
- Avoid exotic/one-off stories (i.e. edge cases).

^ It must make the product better in some way.
The story when complete will make a real-world task faster, better, easier to understand, have fewer steps, or collect better info.

---

# INVEST

- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small and
- Testable

---

# Time limitations & Roles

- divide into groups of 4 or 5
- choose a __Product Owner__ - you will decide prioritization
- choose a __Development Lead__ - you will track estimates
- choose __Developer(s)__
- choose __End User(s)__

## Develop an app for playing tic-tac-toe


---

# Write at least 3 user stories

-  “publish” your stories on the wall or table as soon as they are written, but no criticism of stories is allowed during this phase.

^ 5 minutes

---

# Backlog Grouping

- present the cards to your group
- group duplicates or overlaps
- you may write new stories
- you may rewrite or reword stories
- if everyone agrees that a story is obsolete or going in the wrong direction throw it away or add it to a reserve pile

^ 5 minutes

---

# Backlog Prioritization

- Rank stories, no ties
- Product Owner sets the priorities and has final say

^5 minutes

---

# Quick Estimation

- 60 seconds per story
- Each person produces a Small, Medium or Large estimate for each story
- If a story is too large it can quickly be split into smaller stories

^If 120 seconds goes by, the development lead writes something down no matter what. If any stories seem too long or large, they can be quickly split into multiple smaller stories.

^ up to 15 minutes total

---

# Reprioritization

^ 3 minutes

- some stories may be surprisingly easy or hard, the priorities may change after your estimation in the previous step

^ Given the estimates, the stories may be reprioritized or adjusted. This is usually an important learning phase. Usually, there are stories which are surprisingly easy or surprisingly hard, and, given their cost, the order in which they are to be accomplished clearly changes.

---

# Format checking

^2 minutes

- Confirm that each story is in the correct format: “As a ____, I need a ____ in order to ____”.

---

# INVEST checking

- On the back of the card, write a description of the test(s) for the story

^5 minutes

^Try to make sure that each story is testable by writing a description of the test on the back of the card. This should lead to a lively discussion between the developers and end-users.

# How did story writing go?

- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What would you do differently next time?
