# INTRO

The Galvanize Immersive programs are hard!  Sometimes people want to quit.  If you don’t know why you are there then your chances of quitting are much higher.  Come to this session to learn a four step strategy you can share with students to get through the toughest obstacles.  AND…teaching the immersive is HARD for the teacher as well, so this strategy is essential (IMO) for the instructor as well.  So, we will focus on the teacher side of the equation including 2 tools for evaluating where you are and reviewing your purpose.

# PREWORK
- At the end of your normal shower take a 10-20 second shower on full cold.  Note your internal thought process/reaction to this.
- Spend 15-20 minutes creating a brief personal mission statement for your career.  What is your “why?”  Your mission statement is the unique intersection of what you love to do, what you value and what you can give to the world.  Your personal mission statement is different than Galvanize’s mission statement.
