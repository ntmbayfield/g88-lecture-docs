# Git for Teams

---

## Use a feature branch workflow and/or Pull Requests

---

## Use good branch names.

^^ no spaces, no capital letters

---

## Keep Master clean. It should always be working.

---

## Do NOT make commit
- Rebase branches (e.g. production)
- Merge branches to Master

---

## Merge conflicts should be handled frequently.

---

## Merge conflicts should be handled on the feature branch.

---

## What does a merge conflict look like?

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
color: red
=======
color: blue
>>>>>>>
```

---

## Look at the changed files in the pull request on GitHub.

^^ When submitting a pull request you can see all of the changes that have been made on this feature branch.


---

## Communicate, communicate, communicate!
