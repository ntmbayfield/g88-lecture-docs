# Git

What is Git?

Why do we need it?

> We need to track changes to our files over time

How do we use it?

> A command-line tool allows us to perform actions (fetch, commit, etc.)

# Github

What is Github?

> Hosting for git repositories on remote server plus Github specific features like collaborators, pull requests, issues

Why do we need it?

> If we want collaborators or hosting we need more than Git

How do we use it?

> Either through website (pull requests, issues) or CLI (pushes to hosting)
