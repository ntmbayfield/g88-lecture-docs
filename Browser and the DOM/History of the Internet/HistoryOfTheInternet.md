#TCP/IP

^ 1974 is when a protocol was specified.

^ Worked with both satellite packet based networks and ground radio packet based networks.

^TCP manages breaking the message into packets and reassembling them.

^IP handles the addressing, so the packets get to the right place. IP Doesn't care what order the packets arrived or even if they got there at all.  The sender acknowledges they received the transmission.

^Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn

#NSFNET

^ARPA's primary mission was funding cutting edge research and development, not running a communications utility. 

^The DOD spun off the military portions of the ARPANET to create MILNET

^Many other networks were also created in this time.  NSFNET became the 'defacto' backbone of the internet.

^National Science Foundation Network.

^ARPANET and NSFNET provided interconnectivity.

^Many other networks emerged at the time, many of which became a part of the internet backbone.

^ARPANET was decomissioned in 1990.

^Commercial traffic prohibited.
