# NSBE - National Society of Black Engineers

These are the files from the lesson I (Teddi) did for the HTML/CSS beginner track a the NSBE conference in 2016.

[Intro to HTML and CSS](https://github.com/gSchool/intro-html-css)

The slides for the lesson are in the slides directory of this repo. I ultimately decided to use the shorter slide deck and go with a code along style lesson because I wanted the students to have more hands-on experience. I used the code along steps from the intro-html-css repo and showed that in a split screen with me coding the site live.

The intro-html-css repo is public so the students were able to fork and clone it. The slides were displayed using Marp.

The grid.html page was to show a demo of what the grid system looks like and how the grid changes as I resize the browser.
