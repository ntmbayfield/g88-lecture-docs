# API Hackathon

In preparation for the upcoming hackathon, explore the [API List](https://github.com/gSchool/api-list)
and find several that you are interested in working with.

## Tips

- Explore your API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- Try submitting a get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to make sure it is working.
- Run a server that serves your webpage (lite-server or python simple server)
`lite-server` `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`


## Requirements

- Do NOT use the CORS Chrome extension.
- Select an API.
- Read their documentation (if you can find it,lol)
- Explore and play!
- Be prepared for frustration! This is the time to run into problems, make mistakes, and learn a TON.
- Make an AJAX call to your API. What type of data is returned? JSON, XML, or something else?
- Does a GET request work in Postman?
- Does a GET request work in your browser with an $.ajax or $.get request?
- Does a GET request work in your browser after you have run a server to serve your site?
- Did you run into any CORS errors? What is CORS?
- Contribute to our [class spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQlBz2YU1HgGIykzJc9sZVILJlmAt-Fu5H-sWcERptc/edit?usp=sharing)
- If you run into a stumbling block with your API, check with an instructor for next steps.
- If you are able to make a request to your API without problems, choose another API and start from the beginning.


## CORS Proxy

Some APIs require you to access them server to server. In this case you may need to create a proxy server. If you're feeling like you want to take on a challenge, fork and clone [this](https://github.com/gSchool/corsproxy) repo and create a proxy server of your own. You will need to create a [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/) to do this.
