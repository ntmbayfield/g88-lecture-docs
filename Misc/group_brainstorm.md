# Brainstorming:

## Purpose

This exercise allows everyone's voice to be heard. Each person has time and is expected to think about the problem and share their ideas with the group.

# Process
An instructor facilitates the following -

1. form a group of 4, take 2 sheets of paper per person + 1 sheet for the group
1. think of a problem that you have in your life- examples (traffic, finding something to cook, studying, etc.).
1. Discuss as a class and select a problem to work on. (not asking for solutions, just understanding the problem)
1. each person will think of a solution to the problem and draw out (a rudimentary) wireframe idea for the solution (5 minutes)
1. After a few minutes you will explain your idea to the group (1 min/person)
1. Then each person revises and draws out on the 2nd paper their idea based on new thoughts from the group, feel free to steal ideas from team members to incorporate into your idea(5 minutes)
1. present your updated version to the group (1 min/person)
1. as a group, formulate a finalized idea to present to the class (10 minutes)
1. present to the class, if there is time or display pages on whiteboards for people to look at later (2 min/group)
