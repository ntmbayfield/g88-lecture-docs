# Culture and Expectations

---

## Instructors

* Instructors are not necessarily available to you nights, lunches, or weekends- respect our time
* The current instructors are not necessarily "your" instructors
* Everyone you talk to is just a data point

---

## Culture of Outcomes

* Galvanize is not a recruiting agency, you are not assured graduation, and you are not guaranteed a job
* This is a culture of outcomes- "graduation" doesn't actually matter, only getting and keeping a job does

---

## Classroom
* No messing with the thermostat- 72
* Don't be a "bomb thrower" during lectures
* Attendance matters, and will be recorded often
* Be visible and network
* Be a good neighbor
  * Don't be too loud on 4
  * Clean the classroom
  * Do the dishes
  * Work the steam cleaner

---

## Beware the free beer- don't be a drunk a**hole

---

### Culture of collaboration
* 30 in, 30 out- help each other out and get your classmates to the end of the program
* You are here together
* You are sources of info for each other
* The best way to learn is to teach
* Collaboration is a skill
* If you want to go fast, go alone- if you want to go far, go together

---

### Interactions
* Be mature and inclusive
* Go to meetups, and do them together!
* Respect each other's boundaries
  * There's a difference between asking for help, and giving unasked help
* Dating within the cohort has extremely high potential for discomfort and drama

---

### Cohort events aren't self-organizing. Someone will have to step up if you want a class blog, study group, etc. They are easy to do and have a high return of interest.

---

## Forget everything you know about grades, tests and traditional education
_There is no B- in server-side development_

---

## You are here to learn to be a "Developer"
* Software Development is not like chemistry or algebra
  * Where there is a relatively finite amount of information that you need to learn.
* The field and the frameworks/languages we learn and use are constantly changing

---

## The PREMIUM SKILL a developer needs to have is how to translate knowledge from one language to another and adapt / learn new things as the field grows.

---

### Being lectured to all of the time is comfortable but it doesn't build the skill sets needed to survive in this field.

---

### You have to do it.  You have to struggle and fail and eventually succeed to build the "chops" for any kind of development in this new economy.
