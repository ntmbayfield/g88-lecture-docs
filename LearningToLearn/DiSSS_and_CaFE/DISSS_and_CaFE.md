For a foreign language, it would be a word.

---

# __S__ for Selection.

What 20% of those minimum units will lead to 80% of your desired outcomes?

For cooking, it would be basic knife handling skills.

What’s the most effective order for learning these units?

For cooking, most cookbooks have the wrong sequence for beginners, since what newbie really wants to cook 6 chicken dishes in a row?

---

# __S__ for Stakes.

What psychological and social mechanisms can you setup for discipline and motivation?

For example, you could publicly announce your goal and a deadline, and have your friends keep you accountable.

1. Encoding

---

# __C__ for Compression.

Can I compress the most important 20% into an awesome cheatsheet?

Setup a SCHEDULE. 5 minutes/day won’t do squat since you’ll barely warm up your brain before time’s up.
