## What is an idea?

In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, 
even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. 
A new or original idea can often lead to innovation.

----

## Your idea does not have to be innovative or original. It can be fun, silly, or for educational purposes.
