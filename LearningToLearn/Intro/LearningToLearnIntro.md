^Procrastination happens when you worry about product.

^Example - Writing the short story vs writing for the next 20 minutes.

^Turn and Talk and give an example of product vs process.

^ Defining success as simply spending time doing focused and deliberate practice.

^ This program is going to be very difficult at times. You may not fully understand some of the concepts on the first try. And you may not reach your end goal in the period of time that you set out to do your work.

^ This is perfectly fine so long as you're challenging yourself to get better while in the zone of proximal development.

Since you've been sitting for a while, feel free to stand up and stretch your legs too.
