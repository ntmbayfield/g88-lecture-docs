# Learning to Learn

---

## Being a student in this program is like drinking from a firehose.

---

## It's going to feel like information is just gushing out of your instructors on a daily basis with no way to control the flow.

---

## Since you probably haven't been a student in a while, this lesson will help prepare you to retain as much of that information as possible.

---

## AKA: How to be a sponge

# Why is becoming a better learner important?

---

## Learning is essential to being a programmer.

---

## Galvanize will be a transformative experience for you.

## In addition to learning programming skills, you will grow your habits and mindsets.

---

---

## Galvanize is _not_ the Status Quo

* At an average college or code school, you'd learn a lot, but you'd probably fall back into the same habits and mindsets you had before you started.
* Yes, you'd be better off for having gone back to school, but you wouldn't really have been transformed.

---

## Galvanize _will_ transform you

* With our strong instructional team, teaching techniques, curriculum, and environment, you can learn two to three times as much at Galvanize.
* Because we operate on habits and mindsets, with the intention of helping you become a better learner, you can continue to grow at an accelerated rate even after the Galvanize program is over.

---

## This difference in learning speed before and after the program is what it means to be transformed and to become a new person.

---

# How do I become a better learner?

---

## 1. Set the stage
## 2. Play
## 3. Reflect

---

### Exercise

* Take out a notebook or open up your note taking program
* When you encounter one of these steps and its sub-steps, write it down.
* Write down anything that resonates with you
  * We'll be sharing these later

---

## 1. [Set the stage]()
## 2. Play
## 3. Reflect

---

## Set the stage

This step of the process is about priming your brain to receive new information. Setting the stage consists of three sub-steps.

1. Clear the stage
1. Clarify the what and the why
1. Prioritize process over product

---

### Set the stage: Clear the stage

We have very limited space in our working memory, if you hope to learn as much as possible and to think as critically as possible, you need to get those things out of your head.

* Write everything down that is on your mind, and store it in a safe place - make a todo list
* Close all unnecessary programs and browser tabs
* Turn off all distractions and notifications
  * If you haven't already done so, take a moment to turn off all the distractions that are around you right now.

---

### Clear the stage: Clarify the what and the why

**The what:** Your objective, your goal, or whatever you're trying to achieve when you're setting out to learn.

* Our lessons explicitly say what the objectives are.
* When you're off learning on your own, come up with an objective of sorts to help you clarify and distill what you hope to achieve at the end of your session.

---

### Clear the stage: Clarify the what and the why

**The why:** The meaning or motivation behind the learning.

* No matter the topic, have a clear understanding of why the topic is important, how it'll help, or how it relates to the bigger picture.
* Your instructors have a responsibility to clarify the why for you as well
  * If you're ever unsure about why we're teaching you something, just ask.

---

### Clear the stage: Prioritize process over product

* Define success as simply spending time doing focused and deliberate practice.
* Even if you don't fully understand the concepts or get it on the first try, this is perfectly fine so long as you're challenging yourself to get better while in the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development).

---

---

## Clear the stage: Prioritize process over product: ZPD

While in the zone of proximal development, doing focused and deliberate practice while learning and doing will produce far more quality results in the long run.

If you're doing the opposite: prioritizing product over process, you're much more likely to take shortcuts, to cheat, or to do something that benefits you in the short term but harms you in the long run.

Top performers do what's hard, not what they're good at.

---

### Exercise

Imagine that a friend came to Galvanize and asked you, "Hey everyone is talking about setting the stage. What does that mean? Why is that important? How do you do that?" Take a few moments to think about what you'd say to your friend.

---

## What are the 3 steps to "Set the Stage"?

---

1. Clear the stage
1. Clarify the what and the why
1. Prioritize process over product

---

## What is the ZPD?

---

Zone of proximal development: something a learner can do _with_ guidance.

---

## 1. Set the stage
## 2. [Play]()
## 3. Reflect

---

## Play

This word is chosen very carefully as children learn at much faster rate than adults and neurological research suggests that play has a big part of it.

Children just have different attitudes when it comes to what they're trying learn and why they're doing it.

Like setting the stage, this step of the process consists of three sub-steps as well.

1. Wrestle with it
1. Take risks
1. Have fun!

---

### Play: Wrestle with it

* Think about the content from different perspectives.
* Never be satisfied with exposing yourself to new information only once.
* Ask yourself questions about it, dive in, try to learn as much as you can about it.

---

### Exercise: Play

Pick up an object that's close by, preferably something light and not too expensive.

If you look at this object just once from and from one angle, then you'll have a very two-dimensional perspective of it. It would be hard to claim that you fully understand it. But if you turn it around and look at it from different angles, smell it, taste it, rub your fingers across it, you gain familiarity and build fluency with it.

---

### Play at Galvanize

Just exposing yourself to something once will never be enough:

So read about it, write notes about it, write code about it, write blogs about it, talk about it, and listen about it. Do everything you can to perceive new information from as many different angles as possible so it's massaged into your long term memory.

---

### Play: Take risks

* Be willing to make mistakes.
* Be willing to do something you don't know how to do yet with the understanding that it may not work out like you intend.

When it comes to learning through play, it's the effort, and not the intelligence, that makes the biggest difference. This aligns with the research done around fixed mindset versus growth mindset.

---

### Play: Have fun!

If you find your jaw clenched, your shoulders tight, or your breath panicked while you're wrestling and taking risks, you're probably not having much fun. And if you're not having fun, then you're really not playing.

---

### Play: Have fun!

When you find yourself not having fun:
* Take a deep breath
* Step outside, go for a walk
* Do whatever you need to do to regain focus on the why.

Remember, programming is just about the coolest thing you can do in this world! If that's not how you feel when you're in this program, it's time for a break.

---

### Exercise

Imagine a friend asks you: "Hey, what's this play business all about? Why is that important? How do you do that?"

---

## What are the 3 steps to Play?

---

1. Wrestle with it
1. Take risks
1. Have fun!

---

## 1. Set the stage
## 2. Play
## 3. [Reflect]()

---

## Reflect

Whenever the learning period is done, it's time to reflect on what happened.

Like setting the stage and play, this step of the process consists of three sub-steps.

1. Self assess
1. Ask new questions
1. Repeat

---

### Reflect: Self assess

The first part of reflection is to self assess by asking yourself the following.

- What were my objectives?
- How far did I get?
- How much is left?
- How was the process?
- Did I set the stage well?
- Did I play well?
- What can I do better next time?

Reflecting is one of the secrets as to why students who come through Galvanize leave transformed. They learn how to think about their own thought process and provide themselves feedback.

---

### Reflect: Ask new questions

This is a powerful learning technique that helps you solidify what you know, what you still don't know, and what's most important to learn next.

Forming new questions also primes you to start the cycle again by providing the motivation to keep learning. Nothing is better than a really juicy question that you're just dying to solve.

---

### Reflect: Repeat

As mentioned earlier, learning never stops for programmers as there's always something new to master. The best part about mastering this learning process is that the more you practice it, the faster and easier you'll retain new information.

### Exercise

Picture someone who's struggling with a part of this process, maybe with clearing the stage or taking risks or self assessment. Imagine what it would look like and sound like to watch and hear someone struggling. Take a moment visualize this and then write down your thoughts.
