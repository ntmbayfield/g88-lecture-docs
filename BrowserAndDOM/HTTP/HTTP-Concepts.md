# HTTP Concepts: Conceptualized

---

## Objectives
- Explain what HTTP is & why it's useful.
- Explain what an HTTP request & response is.
- Diagram the HTTP request-response cycle.
- Send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses for HTML.
- Explain what JSON is & why it's useful.
- Send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses for JSON.

## HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol
**Hypertext:** Text has uses "hyperlinks" to other documents
**HTML:** HyperText Markup Language
**WWW:** All the public hypertexts in the world
**HTTP:** A protocol used for transferring HTML and other data.

A **protocol** is a set of rules that allow two networked devices to transmit data.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN created HTTP/HTML in '89/'90 as well as the first browser Mosaic, thereby starting the WWW.

---

## HTTP
- HTTP is based on a requestâ€“response scheme.
- It shuttles messages between two programs called a client and a server. In the case of the WWW, the browser is the client and the web server (or server app) is the server.
- HTTP is useful because it provides a uniform interface for communication even as clients and servers are substituted.

## HTTP Request
When a Client sends a message to a Server on behalf of the user, this is called a request.

Examples of Clients:
- Browsers
- Search engine web crawlers
- Desktop apps (cURL, wget, others)
- Mobile apps

---

## HTTP Request Anatomy
1. A method (aka verb, e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
1. A path
1. An HTTP version
1. Key-Value pairs called headers
1. An optional body

---

## HTTP Request Example
```HTTP
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: some-app.herokuapp.com
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.3
```

**T&T:** Can you identify the parts of the above HTTP request?

---

## Request Methods
**GET:** Retrieve a resource, like HTML or CSS files from a server
**POST:** Send data, like form field values/data, to a server
**PUT:** Update a resource on a server
**DELETE:** Delete a resource on a server

---

**QUESTION:** When does a web browser make GET requests? When does it make POST requests?

---


## HTTP Response
After the web server receives a request and does some processing, it replies with an HTTP response.

Popular web servers that generate such responses include Apache, Nginx, Node.js, and Python's SimpleHTTPServer.

---

## HTTP Response Anatomy
1. An HTTP version
1. A status code
1. Key-Value headers
1. An optional body

---

## HTTP Response Example
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 631
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Sun, 22 May 2016 22:54:23 GMT
Etag: W/"277-ENWB837FwX/qicQv2cu/qA"
Server: Cowboy
Vary: Accept
Via: 1.1 vegur

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Student Roster</title></head>
  <body><content></content></body>
</html>
```

---

**T&T:** Looking at the last slide, can you identify the parts of an HTTP response?

---

## HTTP Response Status Codes
Each status code informs the client how the request was handled.[^1]

|Status Code Group|Description|
|---|---|
|1XX|Accepted, ready for the next one.|
|2XX|Accepted, the server's work is complete.|
|3XX|Accepted, but additional client work is needed.|
|4XX|Accepted, but there was an error on the client.|
|5XX|Accepted, but there was an error on the server.|

[^1]: [www.httpstatuses.com](http://www.httpstatuses.com)

---

**T&T:** The most common status codes are 200, 302, 304, 404, and 500. What do they mean?

## Request-Response Cycle

[Wesley Reid Sequence Diagram](http://slides.com/wesleyreid/how-the-web-works#/2/9)

---

## HTML Request/Response
cURL, wget, and HTTPie are all command line HTTP clients. Just like your browser they make requests and display responses from a server, except they don't do any page rendering-- they output the raw response.

**Let's Try:** cURL, HTTPie

```bash
curl -v -X GET https://fs-student-roster.herokuapp.com/students

brew install httpie
http -v GET https://fs-student-roster.herokuapp.com/students
```

---

## JSON What
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- A common data exchange format on the Web
- Is a string that looks very similar to native objects and arrays
- JSON strings must be parsed in order for it to be useable as objects in JS
- We call this a "serialized" format

---

**NOTE:** Both JSON strings and JSON object keys must be wrapped in double quotes ""

```javascript
{
  "avatar": "https://i.imgur.com/KlycRG5.jpg",
  "hobby": "Motherhood",
  "name": "Daenerys Targaryen"
}
```

---

JSON Array of Objects

```javascript
[
  {
    "avatar": "https://i.imgur.com/KlycRG5.jpg",
    "hobby": "Motherhood",
    "name": "Daenerys Targaryen"
  },
  {
    "avatar": "https://i.imgur.com/fFMusdC.png",
    "hobby": "Traveling",
    "name": "Tyrion Lannister"
  }
]
```

---

## JSON Why

Why bother converting our objects/arrays to strings (serialization)?

- More easily stored in a file, in a database, or transmitted across a network
- A receiving program can parse this string and the object/array is perfectly reconstructed
- Allows the programs involved in the sending/receiving to be very different, even written in different languages
- The data remains intact from end to end

---

## JSON Request/Response

**Let's Try:**

```bash
http -vj GET http://fs-student-roster.herokuapp.com/students
```

**T&T:** What differences can you spot in the request/response compared to the previous HTML example?

## Related Network Concepts
**IP Address:** Required for communicating on the Internet
- Private: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x
- Public: All others

**DHCP:** Service which dynamically assigns IP addresses
**DNS:** Domain Name Servers: Internet equivalent of a phone book
**localhost/127.0.0.1:** A name and IP that refers to this machine

---

**Ports:**
- A network service (aka daemon, server) is open for communication on a particular port(s). E.g. 80=HTTP, 21=FTP
- There are 65,535 possible ports to use
- Root access is required for ports <1024

**SSL/TLS:** Secure Sockets Layer & Transport Layer Security
- Allows for encrypted HTTP traffic. Banks, and any login/auth page
- You are using this when you see HTTPS:// in browser URL, and lock icon
