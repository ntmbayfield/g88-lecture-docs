## DOM

---

## Standards

- Discuss key Frontend concepts
    - Define and describe DOM
- Write JavaScript against the DOM API  
    - Finds existing elements by id and className in order to make changes
    - JavaScript appears at bottom of body tag, or uses DOMContentLoaded/$.ready to attach properly
    - Mutates properties on existing DOM elements such as style, classNames
    - Creates and appends DOM elements

---

## Objectives

- Define the DOM
- Describe five ways to interact with the DOM

---

## Document Object Model

The DOM is an API, where API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface.
Simply put, an API is a way for programs to interact with each-other.

Similarly, the browser's DOM API provides other programs the ability to interact with the document. It provides:

- a way to represent a document as an object.
- a way to access and manipulate a document.

## DOM Traversal

The `document` allows us to find, access, modify, add and remove nodes.

Querying the `document` works the same way, we can use selectors to query for elements based on ID, class name, name and tag name.

## What happens if JS is loaded at the top of the body?

### Always remember to

[onreadystatechange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState) event listener

or
