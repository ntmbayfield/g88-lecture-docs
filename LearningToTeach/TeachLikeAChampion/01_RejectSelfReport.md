#[fit]Reject Self Report

---

> "Replace functionally rhetorical questions with more objective forms of impromptu assessment."
-- Teach Like A Champion

---

##Questions like

> "Is everyone clear on ...?"
> <br>
> "Everyone got it?"

<br>

Is an example of **self-report**.

*i.e. Asking the students to evaluate themselves.*

---

Self-report is highly unreliable.

Questions that ask for a yes or no are highly suspect.

---

Why?

---

The questions are functionally rhetorical.  The students respond with silence.

Whether people understand or not, they say they do, particularly in groups.

---

In groups people don't speak up due to embarassment or fear they would co-opt the better interests of the group.

They assume they are the only one that didn't get it and it wouldn't be fair to speak up.

---

Students often don't know they missed something ... because they missed it.

---

The way we ask the question, with a wait time of a fration of a second, sends the message that we don't expect anyone to speak up.

---

Does this mean I can never ask "Got it?" - certainly not.  It is such a familiar habit its almost impossible to root it out completely.

---

Understand how often we use self-report and that it is functionally rhetorical.  We use it as a natural transition point.  Asking rhetorical questions like "Got it?" can squander the opportunity and be counterproductive.  

---

Self-Monitoring

---

At first self-monitoring might seem like self-report.

---

>"On a scale of 1-4, how prepared for the test are you?"

---

We use self-monitoring not to guage mastery - its too unreliable for that - but to develop the students own skills of self-awareness.

---

Self-monitoring is when students reflect intentionally on their own level of mastery.

---

Encouring the students to reflect as you ask targeted questioning is another way to encourage self-monitoring.

> "I am going to ask a series of questions, if you are not getting all of these its a sign you might need some extra practice.  In that case, come see me."

---

Self-monitoring can also include asking students to identify topics they struggled with, instead of "got it".

---

Establish clearly that you are making time for this and you're expectation is for students to identify topics they are struggling with.

---

Self-monitoring can be highly valuable but require a significant time investment.

Technique 2 - Targeted Questioning can replace self-report at a much lower cost.
