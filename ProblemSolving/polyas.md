# Whiteboard Interview Prep (groups)

---

# Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to do the following:

- Run the Solve It! drill effectively with a group

---

# Exercise Format

- Form a group of 4.
- Each person chooses a role
- Focus on the problem-solving technique

^ Every time you meet, you will repeat the same process. One person will practice taking an interview, then rotate and another person will take the interview etc... Your group will have the following roles:

---

# Roles

- interviewee
- interviewer
- observer (feedback that is Actionable, Specific, Kind)
- fact checker

^One person is the interviewee - they are the ones who write on the whiteboard / solve the problem
^One person is the interviewer - they state the problem and answer questions
^One person is the observer and fills out the observation form
this form or this one
^One person is the fact checker and types the code character-for-character to see if it works
^If there are more than four, the others take notes / provide feedback that is ASK (Actionable, Specific and Kind)

---

# Time

- Each round should take no longer than 15 minutes so that everyone has a chance to practice. 10 minutes to work through the problem and 5 minutes for feedback.

---

# After the Interview

- The fact checker should runs the final code and report results
- The observer should hand the paper feedback form to the interviewee
- The interviewee should enter it into their Journal so they can track their progress

---

# The Interviewer

^Your role is to:

^Choose a problem that's appropriate (we'll have a bank of them for you, and also Cracking the Coding interview)
Explain the problem (ideally leaving out a detail or two that'll come out in questions)
Answer questions they have
Try to help them get unstuck without giving away the answer with things like:
"what's the value of this variable here...?"
"what would you like your array to look like after this first loop?"
etc...
Keep track of time and call time when it's 15 minutes
If the interviewee goes through the answer very quickly, here are some fun ways to keep the interview going:

^Ask them what the runtime of the function is, and also the memory complexity (Big O)
If they have a loop, ask them to do it without a loop, or with recursion
If they have lots of variables, ask them to do it with no variables (often requires lots of tiny functions, so may not be appropriate)

---

# The Interviewee

^When you are interviewing, be sure to:

^Confirm two-to-three inputs/outputs before starting
Ask questions that might reveal hidden requirements / important edge cases
Discuss more than one approach, choose one and explain your choice
Write code
Use sandwich code
close brackets and parens as soon as you open them
return variables in accumulator patterns right away, before writing code
Think out loud - constantly narrate, don't "go dark"
Test your code (check your work)
Put a variable in
Trace it through the code
Write down the values at each step if necessary
Freely admit your mistakes
Thank the interviewer

---

# The Observer

^The observer needs to carefully pay attention to and record the following things:

^Interviewee name / date
Start / end and total time
Did the code compile? (ask the fact checker)
Did the code solve the problem? (get group feedback, check with the fact checker)
How many questions did they ask?
How many long pauses did they have? (where long pauses are subjective, but 10 seconds of inactivity / talking is long)
Overall Communication (on a scale of 1-4):
Did they ask basic questions (language, compile or pseudo code)?
Did they clarify inputs / outputs with examples?
Did they explain their thought process as they worked? (i.e. not "going dark")
Did they check their work by actually interpreting the code / running inputs through?
Did they thank the interviewer and shake hands?

---

# The Fact-checker

^Transcribe the code exactly as-is - down to the space and semi-colon. At the end, run sample input through, and see if you get the expected output. Show the group if you have any questions. You'll be asked by the Observer for your findings.

---

# The Videographer (optional)

^Phones / space / noise permitting, one additional observer can take the interviewee's phone and record the interview, so the interviewee can watch it later an reflect on the feedback.

^Interviewees may want to watch themselves so they can see what the interviewer sees (as far as communication, nervousness etc...)

---

# Rotation

Setup a rotation in your group so that everyone plays each role on a rotating basis. The idea is to give each person as much interaction / exposure as possible to this process.

# Polya's Problem Solving Technique

1. Understand the problem
1. Devise a plan
1. Carry out the plan
1. Look back

^Understand the Problem
Identify Inputs and Outputs
Ask "What if" Questions

^Devise a Plan
Come up with more than one possible solution
Choose a solution based on Performance, Maintainability and your Capability

^Carry Out the Plan
Quickly dispense with boilerplate code
Write code 'outside in'

^Look Back
Check for correctness
Look for opportunities to refactor
DRY
SOLID
