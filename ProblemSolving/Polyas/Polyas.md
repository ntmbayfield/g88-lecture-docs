# Problem Solving Framework Steps

1. Understand the Problem
1. Devise a Plan
1. Carry Out the Plan
1. Look Back

---

# STEP ONE: Understand the Problem
  * Identify Inputs and Outputs
  * Ask "What if" Questions

---

# STEP TWO: Devise a Plan
  * Come up with more than one plan
  * Choose a solution based on:
    - Your Ability
    - Code's Performance
    - Code Maintainability / Readability

---

# STEP THREE: Carry Out the Plan
  * Quickly dispense with boilerplate code
  * Write code 'outside in' ("sandwich code")

---

# STEP FOUR: Look Back
  * Ensure the correctness of your solution (and keep working until it's correct)
  * Once it's correct, decide where you want to go:
    - You could refactor https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-curriculum/blob/master/Refactoring.md
    - You could burn-and-build (delete and rewrite)
    - You could write a real test suite
