# 4 Pillars of OOP

---

# Objectives:

BY THE END OF THIS LESSON YOU WILL BE ABLE TO...
- Name the 4 Pillars of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Define Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Describe examples of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

# Activity: OOP Jigsaw

Define, Find an example from your group project, and Describe why this it is useful for maintainable code


1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

# Game Plan:

1. Meet in Learning Group and Divide Topics (5 minutes)
2. Research on Own (10 minutes)
3. Meet in Expert Groups (10-15 minutes)
4. Meet in Learning Group and teach each other topics (20 minutes)
5. Group Review

# 1. Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of exposing essential featurse of an entity
while hiding other irrelevant detail.

Abstraction reduces code complexity and at the same time it makes your code aesthetically pleasant.

---

# 2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.

---

# 3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents "is-a-type-of" relationships. For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names.

---

## Inheritance Example:
A class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names. For example, class Person might define variables "first_name" and "last_name" with method "fullName()". These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables "position" and "salary".

---

# 4. Polymorphism

Subtyping, a form of polymorphism, is when calling code can be agnostic as to whether an object belongs to a parent class or one of its descendants.

---

## Polymorphism Example:
A function might call "fullName()" on an object, which will work whether the object is of class Person or class Employee. This is another type of abstraction which simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong separation of concerns.
