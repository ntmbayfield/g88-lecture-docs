# Objectives
- Review what a recursive function is
- Explain what an exit condition is
- Explain what to pass as an argument to your function
- I do, we do, you do more :smile:

# What is a Recursive Function?

---

### it is a function that calls itself

^ We have been looking at recursive functions which is the first step. Now it is time to talk about how to construct a recursive function

^ If you don't change the input to the function, it will never stop because nothing has changed!

# For Example

---

# Factorial
- 5!
- 5 * 4!
- 5 * 4 * 3!
- 5 * 4 * 3 * 2!
- 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
