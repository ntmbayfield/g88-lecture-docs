# Hash Maps demo

## Purpose

This app is to provide a real world example of how fast hashing can be, in comparison with linear array searches. It does this by counting words in either of the following literary files:

+ `data/alice-in-wonderland.txt`
+ `data/pride-and-prejudice.txt`

You can configure the exact file it counts in the `word-counter-cli.js` file.

## How to install things you need

+ `npm install -g node eslint`
+ `npm install`

## Available `npm` tasks:

+ `npm run demo`: Runs the demo.
+ `npm run test`: Runs the `mocha` test suites.
+ `npm run linter`: Runs the `eslint` files.
