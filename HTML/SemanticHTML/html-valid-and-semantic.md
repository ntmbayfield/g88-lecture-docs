## Tags & Elements

* Opening tags start with a `<`, have a label, and end with `>`.
* Closing tags start with a `</`, have a label, and end with a `>`.
* Some tags are self closing and do not need a `</label>`, like `<input>` and `<br>`.

Tags come with a set of styles defined by the browser. When tags are read by the browser, they become an HTML element.

Between opening and closing tags is optional content.
Content can be text or other tags.

* `<p>` Text content `</p>`
* `<button><a>` `</a></button>`
