Meet Your Instructor:

Teddi Maull

The benevolent queen of Galvanize - she nurtures the weary students through the swamps of shame, the depths of despair, and the valleys of varied degrees of absolute lows. She herself was once amongst those who conquered the full stack as a student of g7. You can hear her soothing voice murmuring sweet Javascript knowledge into the ears of the students who close their eyes, lulled into a false sense of comfort. Alas, if only you could fix a syntax error with your eyes closed. Teddi can.
