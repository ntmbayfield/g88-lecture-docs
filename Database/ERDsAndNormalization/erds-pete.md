# Entity Relationship Diagrams and Normalization

---

- What's an "entity"?

---

- Fancy words like "Cardinality"

---

- Means the type of relationship: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many

---

- Crow's Foot Notation
- How do we use it?

---

- Always points to the table with the FK
- When in doubt, draw it out
- You can never have a double crow's foot
