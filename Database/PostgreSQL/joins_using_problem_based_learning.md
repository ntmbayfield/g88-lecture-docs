# SQL Joins

^ This is meant to be a small group collaboartive learning activity rather than a lecture

---

# Objectives
- Use WHERE to filter data
- SELECT individual fields from a table
- SELECT individual fields from multiple tables using an inner JOIN
- Sort data using ORDER BY
- Use WHERE and JOIN
- Identify primary keys and foreign keys based on schemas and naming convetions
- Use aggregate functions like COUNT and GROUP BY

---

# Plan
- Go over objectives
- Pair up randomly in groups of 3

- Give them this assignment to work on together for 50 minutes. It contains 4 tables with 1 to many and many to many relationships.
https://github.com/gSchool/sql-homework/tree/g62

Give instructions to review the assignment first, make a list of things they need to research (i.e. a learning plan) before doing any of the tasks.   Reccommended resources: Postgres Docs, Learn

- At 50 minute mark, they can propose and up vote specific topics to go over/discuss via sli.do. Students will then answer questions as they  are able with instructor filling in

- CFUs at the end to cycle back through the objectives

# CFUs
- How do you write a join between two tables?
- What is an alias in a query and how is it used?
- What is a primary key?
- What is a foreign key?
- What is a 1-many relationship in this example?
- What is a many-many relationship in this example?
- In general, how are many tables are involved in a  many to many relationship?  How does this prevent repeating data?
