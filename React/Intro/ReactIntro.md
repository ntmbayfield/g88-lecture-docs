# Rise of the SPA

In a single-page application, all of the code needed is included in a single-page load. This includes all of the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The page does not reload, and it requires dynamic interaction with the Web server.

---

Front End Frameworks help to build SPAs.

---

# Advantages

1. Efficiency — projects that used to take months and hundreds of lines of code now can be achieved much faster with well-structured prebuilt patterns and functions.

---

2. Safety — top javascript frameworks have firm security arrangements and are supported by large communities where members and users also act as testers.

---

3. Cost — most frameworks are open source and free. Since they help programmers to build custom solutions __faster__, the ultimate price for web app will be lower.
