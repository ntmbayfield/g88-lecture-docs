# Outline practical use cases functional programming
* Recall writing your first tests for client side JavaScript
* There are two entry points to your code where "side effects" need to be isolated
* Reading from and writing to the DOM are examples of "IO" (Input / Output)
* HTTP requests between client and server are the other entry point

# Immutable data

# Side Effects

* Explain how isolating *side effects* [improves code](https://www.aomran.com/pure-functional-programming/)

# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* A programming *paradigm* like imperative, declarative, object-oriented, etc.
* FP is *declarative* utilizing expressions rather than statements
* *Higher-order functions* allow partial application and currying

# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* *Recursion* is used in place of loops
* Pure functions have no *side effects* giving us referential transparency
* *Immutable data* - Array.map, Object.assign, String

* Classical functional languages - Lisp, ML, Scheme, Prolog
* Modern languages - Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Clojure, Elm, PureScript
* JavaScript, jQuery, React / Redux
* Libraries like Underscore, LoDash, Ramda
