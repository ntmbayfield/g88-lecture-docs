# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* A programming *paradigm* like imperative, declarative, object-oriented, etc.
* FP is *declarative* utilizing expressions rather than statements
* *Higher-order functions* allow partial application and currying (Haskell Curry)

# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* *Recursion* is used in place of loops
* Pure functions have no *side effects* giving us referential transparency
* *Immutable data* - Array.map, Object.assign, String

# Can it help me get a job?
* YES
* Pure functions are easy to test and understand
* Immutable data has [advantages](https://auth0.com/blog/intro-to-immutable-js/)
* JavaScript, jQuery, React / Redux
* Libraries like Underscore, LoDash, Ramda
