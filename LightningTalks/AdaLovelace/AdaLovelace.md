In one of the notes she describes an algorithm for the **Analytical Engine** to compute Bernoulli numbers.

**Ada Lovelace Day** is celebrated in mid October.  

Its goal is to "... raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering and maths," and to "create new role models for girls and women" in these fields.
