# [fit] What is an **Algorithm**

^
An algorithm is a list of steps needed to complete a given task. Programmers create algorithms to solve problems on the computer using code. In this activity we will be identifying algorithms in the real world and then we will create an algorithm for a dice game.

# [fit] What did you do this morning?

^
Ask your students what they did to get ready for school this morning.
Write their answers on the board.
If possible, put numbers next to their responses to indicate the order that they happen.
If students give responses out of order, have them help you put them in some kind of logical order.
Point out places where order matters and places where it doesn't.

# [fit] What are some everyday **algorithms**?

^ making breakfast, brushing teeth, planting a flower, and making paper airplanes.

# [fit] Talking to a Computer

^ Computers need algorithms and programs to show them how to do even simple things that we can do without thinking about them.
It can be challenging to describe something that comes naturally in enough detail for a computer to replicate.
The hardest part about getting a problem ready for a computer can be figuring out how to describe real-life activities. We’re going to get some practice by playing and describing the Dice Race game.

# [fit] Dice Race Game
## partners/teams

^ In this activity, we will create an algorithm to describe how we play the Dice Race Game.
Set each player’s score to 0
Have the first player roll
Add points from that roll to player one’s total score
Have the next player roll
Add points from that roll to player two’s total score
Each player should go again two more times
Check each player’s total score to see who has the most points
Declare Winner
