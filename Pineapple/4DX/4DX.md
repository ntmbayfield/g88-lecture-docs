##Ask 
> If everything else remained the same, what is the one area where change would have the greatest impact?

^Question: The summary suggests that the WIG can come from inside the whirlwind?

#[fit]Rules

---

![left](img/11_1.jpg)

##*No team focuses on more than* two WIGs *at the same time.*

---

![right](img/11_2.jpg)

##*Lower level WIGs should help* achieve *higher level WIGs.*

---

![left](img/11_3.jpg)

##*Leaders can* veto*, but not* dictate.

---

![right](img/11_4.jpg)

##All WIGs must have a finish line.

###*In the form of from X to Y by when.*

---

The WIG must be achievable.

---

Ideas for success.

---

Start by having the team brainstorm possible wigs. No involvement, no commitment.

---

Rank by impact

---

Test the ideas

- Is the team wig aligned to the overall wig?
- Is it measurable?
- Does the team have at least 80% ownership of the results?
- Can the team affect the outcome, or just the leader?

---

Begin with a verb.
Define the lag measure.
Keep it simple.
Focus on the what, not how.

---

#[fit]Discipline 2
#[fit]Lead Measures

---

A lag measure tells you if you've achieved a goal.

---

A lead measure tells you if you are likely to achieve the goal.

---

Example

---

A lead measure is predictive.
A lead measure is influenceable.
The more you act on the lead measure, the more likely you are to achieve the goal.

---

Ideas for success.

---

This is the single most difficult aspect of 4DX.

---

Brainstorm lead measures.

---

Rank by impact - narrow your focus.

---

Test the ideas

- Is it predictive?
- is it influenceable?
- Is it an ongoing process, or a one and done? (an ongoing process that becomes habit is best.
- Can the team do it, or just the leader?
- Can it be measures?
- Is it worth measuring?  What is the cost of measurement?
- Are we tracking team or individual performance?
- How often are we tracking?
- Is it simple?

---

#[fit]Discipline 3
#[fit]Scorecard

---

People will disengage and focus on the whirlwind, unless they know the score.

---

The score is what impact the process is having.

---

Knowing the impact also allows the team to adjust when its not working.

---

4 Questions to ask

---

1. Is it Simple?

---

2. Can I see it easily?

---

3. Does it show lead and lag measures?

---

4. Can I tell at a glance if we are successful?

---

Showing results will engage the team.

---

Example scoreboard

---

Ideas for success

---

The more the team is involved in designing the scorecard, the more ownership they will have.

---

The scorecard should clearly and instantly display the measures you are tracking.

---

Questions to ask.

- Is it simple?
- Can the team see it easily?
- Does it contain both the lead and lag measures?
- Can we tell at a glance if we are successful?

---

Keep it updated!

---

#[fit]Discipline 4
#[fit]Cadence of Accountability

---

The team must meet at least weekly in a WIG session.

---

The meeting lasts no longer than 20-30 minutes.

---

Three Part Agenda

---

Report on commitments.

---

Review the scorebard.  Learn from Successes and Failures.

---

Clear the path and plan new commitments.

---

"What are the one or two most important things I can do this week to impact the lead measures?"

---

Two rules for commitments

---

1.  The commitment must represent a specific and measurable.

---

2.  The commitment must influence the lead measure.

---

You want each team member to take ownership over the commitments they make.

---

Clear the path

---

"What can I do to clear the path for you?"

---

Tips for success

---

Things to avoid

- Competing whirlwind responsibilities
- Holding WIG sessions with no specific outcomes.
- Repeating the same commitment more than two consecutive weeks.
- Accepting unfulfilled commitments.

---

Demonstrate respect to team members

---

Reinforce accountability

---

Encourage performance

---



#What to expect

---

To be successful, you must begin with crystal clarity on the process.

---

The launch requires focus and energy.

---

Adoption will take time.  First focus on the process, then the results.

---

Optimize.  Encourage and recognize ideas for adjusting the lead measures.

---

Celebrate Success.
