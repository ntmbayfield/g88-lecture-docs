I set out to learn a bit of data visualization and interviewed Keith Maull (a data scientist) to learn how to get started. These slides were delivered with that story being told. The story was - I am the student and how do I go about learning something new so I can be productive? What questions do I ask? How do I get started? How do I make progress? In some cases it is enough to go from "I don't know that I don't know" to "I know that I don't know x". Also, data visualization is more about the story you are telling than about learning these tools. The tools can be tricky in some cases, but getting the data into a usable form is the trickier part.
