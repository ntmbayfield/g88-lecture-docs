## Know Your Numbers
Average for market, range for their company, what other skills influence your salary (prior experience, degree, etc.)

# Offer Stage

Note: It's best to negotiation person to person (not through email).

## Go High
Go high so you can come down.  It’s better to give a range with your low end your actual high number.
