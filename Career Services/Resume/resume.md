### A good resume highlights a candidates relevant skills.

---

### It presents the candidate in the best possible light.

---

### It is the first chance to persude the reader you are the best candidate for the job.

# How Resumes Are Read.

^ Most people don't understand how resumes are read.

---

## Resumes aren't read, but glanced at.

^ A recruiter/screener will pick up your resume, skim it and make a snap judgement.

---

## You get 10 seconds to impress the reader.

^ Your resume must be designed to highlight your best accomplishments with only a brief skim.

---

> "Will this convince an employer to interview me?"

---

## Nine Hallmarks of a powerful resume.

^ Each and every line needs to contribute.

---

## 1. Short and sweet

^ Many of the longest resumes are by candidates with less experience.

^ Keep your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years experience.

^ If you have more than ten  years experience, you *might* be able to justify that second page.

^ Longer resumes make you look worse.  If you add more content, but its worse content it brings down your average.

^ If something great is on the second page - the reader might miss it.

^ Avoid large blocks of text.  Readers will tend to skip over paragraphs.

---

## 2. Accomplishment oriented

^ Resumes should highlight what you did, not what you were supposed to do.

^ Watch out for words like *contributed to, participated in* or *helped out with*. This reads more like job responsibilities not accomplishments.

---

## 3. Quantifiable results

^ If you are going to discuss results … quantify them.

^ Quantifing results makes them meaningful by showing the impact you had.  

---

## 4. Well targeted

^ At one time a generalized resume could be forgiven.  Now with resumes being easy to tweak and printed tailoring your resume gives you an edge.

^ The resume should be tailored to the position and to the company.

^ What does the company value?  Does it want its developers to wear many hats? Are they data focused?

---

# Targeting can be done in three ways

- Targeted to the company's product
- Targeted to the job description
- Targeted to the company values.

^ Research - website and job description.

^ Ask yourself - what are the company's biggest issues?  How would my role impact those? Even if you haven't solved the exact problem before - you might have transferable skills that one would need to solve them.

---

## 5. Universally meaningful

^ Watch the jargon.

^ The resume should be meaningful to recruiters, managers and teammates.

^ Avoid acronyms and translate highly technical terminology to plain english.

^ It can't be perfect, but make sure everyone can get the gist of your resume.

---

## 6. Professional

^ Many recruiters will toss your resume for a single typo.  

^ If you can't write a resume correctly, will you be able to write good e-mails and work documents?

---

## Make sure you check your resume for the following issues

- Spelling and grammar
- Consistency
- No first person
- No personal details

^ Make sure you have someone who is strong in grammar and spelling check your resume.

^ You can use either commas or semicolons to separate items on a list … but be consistant.

^End every bullet with a period or don't - but be consistant.

^ Avoid using I, me, or myself.  Use third person throughout except the objective statement which first person is expected.

^ Personal details like marital status, age or gender.

---

## 7. Well formatted

^ If the reader can't find the information they are looking for, they are likely to toss it and move on.

---

# Formatting

- Columns
- Text Formatting
- Margins
- White space

^ Have distinct columns for your job title, companies and dates.

^ Think through how to format the text.  Small formatting changes can matter.

^ Margins should generally be .75 inches or greater - and certainly lot less than .5 inches.

^ Using ample white space will make your resume easy to read.  

---

## 8. List your projects and extracurriculars

^ Include things that show other skills, show initiative and make you special.  

^ Don't include fluff - but include those things that show a different side of you.

---

## 9. Be different

^ It's ok to be a little unique.z

^ Your goal is to show why you would make a great employee. 

^ Ideas - show a picture of the project you created on the resume.

---

# Structure

^ Chronological resumes tend to always have an Employment (or Work History) section and an Education section - but may also include Objective, Summary, Technical Skills or Projects.  What sections you choose depend on your skills, background and desired position.

---

## Objective

#### Objectives take up valuable space.  They are not necessary and should only be used if they add important information.
